<Note>
  First-party libraries, tools, and utilities only differ from third-party in who is publishing the packages. If a [core member](/docs/contribute/contributors/#core-members) of the Pictogrammers group is involved in the publishing step of the package, it is considered first-party.
</Note>

## NPM

Only packages published under the [@pictogrammers](https://www.npmjs.com/org/pictogrammers) or [@mdi](https://www.npmjs.com/org/mdi) organizations are considered first-party.
