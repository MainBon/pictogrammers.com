:::Note{type=info}
First-party libraries, tools, and utilities only differ from third-party in who is publishing the packages. If a [core member](/contributors) of the Pictogrammers is involved in the publishing step of the package, it is first-party.

## NPM

Only packages published under the [@pictogrammers](https://www.npmjs.com/org/pictogrammers) or [@mdi](https://www.npmjs.com/org/mdi) organizations are considered first-party.

### Steps for Publishing

```bash
git pull
# (optional) Update Dependencies
npm update
# (optional) Build
npm run build
# update package.json
# - "version": "1.0.0"
# + "version": "1.0.1"
git status
git add .
git commit -m "v1.0.1"
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "v1.0.1"
git push
git push origin --tags
# Verify on GitHub then...
npm publish
```

## Other

Right now all first-party packages are published through GitHub and NPM.
