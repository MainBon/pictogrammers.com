## Other Material Design Icon Figma Plugins

There are several other Figma plugins that are labeled as "Material Design Icons" in the Figma community. Some are actually created using our icon libraries (which we think is awesome!). However, the Figma plugin in this article is the only [official first-party plugin](/docs/guides/first-party/) by Pictogrammers.
