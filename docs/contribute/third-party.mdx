title: Third-Party Libraries
description: Anyone can make useful tools and utilities with our icon libraries.

While Pictogrammers supports several [first party](./first-party) libraries, utils, and components, our core team leaves a lot of the integrations up to the third-party community.

## Who is a Third Party Developer?

Any developer that provides an integration that relies on Pictogrammers icons. This can be components, utilities, or plugins for existing open-source projects.

## Integrating with Pictogrammers Libraries

The top priority of building an integration is knowing where you'll get the icons. There are three ways to get the icons NPM, the CDN, and GitHub.

### NPM

NPM packages are built after each release.

- The [@pictogrammers](https://www.npmjs.com/org/pictogrammers) and [@mdi](https://www.npmjs.com/org/mdi) organizations on NPM.
- [`@mdi/util`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdi/util) - [Node scripting](/guide/nodejs-scripting) utility for building your own scripts.
- [`@mdi/font-build`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdi/font-build) - This is what builds the webfont! (`@mdi/svg` and `@mdi/light-svg` contain `font-build.json` for this reason).

#### Material Design Icons

- [`@mdi/js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdi/js) - ES6/TypeScript module.
- [`@mdi/svg`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdi/svg) - Individual optimized SVG files
  - `meta.json` - All icon meta data, tags, aliases, font codepoints.
- [`@mdi/font`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdi/font) - Webfont files.

#### Material Design Icons Light

- [`@mdi/light-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdi/light-js) - ES6/TypeScript module.
- [`@mdi/light-svg`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdi/light-svg) - Individual optimized SVG files
  - `meta.json` - All icon meta data, tags, aliases, font codepoints.
- [`@mdi/light-font`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdi/light-font) - Webfont files.

If your project can use one of the first-party libraries indirectly, we recommend telling people to install them separately. For instance `@mdi/react` can use any icon version.

```bash
npm install @mdi/js @mdi/react
```

This allows one to swap out other icon packs or upgrade/downgrade independently. Not all projects can do this, but we recommend it when possible.

### CDN

When we release, `@mdi/svg` and `@mdi/light-svg` are also published to the CDN.

- `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mdi/svg`
- `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mdi/light-svg`

### GitHub

GitHub is where we store all the NPM distribution repos. Each release is tagged so it's easy to view previous changes.

#### Material Design Icons

- [MaterialDesign](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign) - Main Repo Synced Real-time
- [MaterialDesign-SVG](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign-SVG) - SVG Versioned
- [MaterialDesign-JS](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign-JS) - JS Versioned
- [MaterialDesign-Webfont](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign-Webfont) - Webfont Versioned

#### Material Design Icons Light

- [MaterialDesignLight](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesignLight) - Main Repo Synced Real-time
- [MaterialDesignLight-SVG](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesignLight-SVG) - SVG Versioned
- [MaterialDesignLight-JS](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesignLight-JS) - JS Versioned
- [MaterialDesignLight-Webfont](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesignLight-Webfont) - Webfont Versioned

### Build Script

## Guidelines

Third parties should be able to do anything that helps their respective community integrate the use of the icons. With that said there are a few things we advise against.

| Don't do this... | Maybe Try... |
|------------------|--------------|
| <Icon name='mdi:close' color='red' /> Scraping the website for data | <Icon name='mdi:check' color='green' /> Let us know through an issue if `meta.json` is missing anything. |
| <Icon name='mdi:close' color='red' /> Expecting us to add icons since you use the project | <Icon name='mdi:check' color='green' /> We recommend projects to be built to support multiple icon packs and not to rely entirely on ours. |

## Let us know what you built!

Not required, but the core team loves seeing what the community makes. Funny enough, we are often the last ones that find out about all the cool integrations.

## Existing Third Party Projects

Definitely search around and checkout all the existing projects before starting. Your idea might already exist that you can help expand.
